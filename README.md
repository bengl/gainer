# gainer

**`gainer`** is a terminal gopher browser. While it does not support images or
downloading files (yet), it does support general browsing and reading text
files.

You can try `gainer` right away with:

```
$ npx gainer
```

At the moment, the interface is very minimal.

You can start `gainer` at a gopher URL by passing it as a command line option,
or press `g` once gainer is started to open a URL.

When `gainer` is started without a URL, it shows the keybindings, but for now
you should probably know how to quit, which is by pressing `q`.
